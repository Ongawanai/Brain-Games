Brain-games is a set of five games that test your math skills.

To install brain games you need to have git. Install it with these commands:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git-all
```

Then you need to clone my repo with command:

`git clone git@github.com:Ongawanai/frontend-project-44.git`

At last, but not the least, type the command `make install` in the console. Now you can play :)

What games do we have?

Brain-even - generates random numbers, in response to which you must write 'yes' or 'no', depending on whether the number is even or not. To start, just type the command `brain-even` in the console.
