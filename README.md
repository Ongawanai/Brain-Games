Brain-games is a set of five games that test your math skills.

To install Brain-games just type the command 'make install' in the console.

Brain-even - generates random numbers, in response to which you must write 'yes' or 'no', depending on whether the number is even or not. To start, just type the command 'brain-even' in the console.

Brain-even example:

<script id="asciicast-541764" src="https://asciinema.org/a/541764.js" async></script>

Brain-calc - displays a mathematical expression, the result of which you must indicate in the answer field. To start, enter the command 'brain-calc' in the console.

Brain-calc example:

<script id="asciicast-541765" src="https://asciinema.org/a/541765.js" async></script>

Brain-GCD offers you to find the largest common divider (GCD) of two numbers provided. To start the game, enter 'brain-gcd'

Brain-gcd example:

<script id="asciicast-541763" src="https://asciinema.org/a/541763.js" async></script>

Brain-Progression generates algebraic progression, in which one number is missed. Find it and write in the field with an answer. For launch, enter 'Brain-progression'

Brain-progression example:

<script id="asciicast-542650" src="https://asciinema.org/a/542650.js" async></script>

Brain-prime displays a random number on the screen. Enter 'yes' in the answer field if it is simple, or 'no' if it is not. Run command: 'brain-prime'

Brain-prime example:

<script id="asciicast-542649" src="https://asciinema.org/a/542649.js" async></script>
